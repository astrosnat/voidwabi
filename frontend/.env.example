# Frontend Configuration

# Socket.IO Server URL
# Leave blank for automatic detection (recommended for most deployments)
# 
# Auto-detection rules:
# - In local development (localhost:5173): Connects to http://localhost:3000
# - In production with same-origin backend: Uses window.location.origin
# - Works with Render, self-hosted, and any other deployment
#
# Only set this if you need to explicitly override auto-detection:
# Examples:
#   VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000
#   VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-domain.com
#   VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://wabi.onrender.com
